Description: ELE is an open source Coldfusion (i.e. Railio) Web application to allow users to write, edit, update, share, and collaborate on educational materials in the classroom, online, flipped and/or hybrid learning environments. The EQ. LEARNING ENVIRONMENT™ is an open source, universal, online and mobile media environment that utilizes real-time interaction and a "Swiss-Army" approach to learning, combining 1.) the QMX-Wiki®; 2.) the Storyscape® classroom documentation timeline, and; 3.) the QMX Resource Archives® for the benefit of enrolled and guest students, academics, technicians and artists. The goal is for not only the founder of the application to create content for students and colleagues, but for the students and colleagues themselves to interact with and contribute to the learning environment, creating a media-educational space that continues to augment itself across time. Enjoy!
